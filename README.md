# 🧠 Sentiment Analysis ML Project (Complete Pipeline)

This repository contains a complete machine learning pipeline for **sentiment analysis** of product reviews using Python and scikit-learn.

The project was developed as part of a learning module, where we demonstrated all typical phases of a machine learning workflow — from raw data to a ready-to-use trained model.

## ✅ What We Did in This Module

Throughout this module, we covered all major steps of a real-world ML project:

### 1. Project Setup
- Created a new GitHub repository
- Defined project folder structure
- Uploaded raw dataset

### 2. Data Exploration
- Loaded and analyzed a large dataset with product reviews
- Used `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for visualizations
- Investigated distribution of sentiments and text characteristics

### 3. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Removed missing values
- Standardized sentiment labels (positive / negative / neutral)
- Parsed and validated prices
- Converted review text to numerical length

### 4. Feature Engineering
- Selected meaningful input features: `review_title`, `review_text`, and `review_length`
- Removed irrelevant columns
- Explored correlation between price and sentiment

### 5. Model Training & Evaluation
- Compared multiple ML models (Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM)
- Used `ColumnTransformer` and `Pipeline` for unified preprocessing
- Evaluated using precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix

### 6. Final Model Training
- Trained final model on full dataset
- Saved the pipeline using `joblib` to `sentiment_model.pkl`

### 7. Inference & Usage
- Loaded saved model
- Built an interactive interface for predicting sentiment of new reviews
- Enabled real-time testing via console input

## 🚀 How to Use

### 🔧 Train the Model
```bash
cd src
python train_model.py
```
This will create a file called sentiment_model.pkl in the root directory.

### 🔍 Run Inference
Use the interactive script (model_test.py) to classify new reviews using the trained model.
